This version includes the additional buildings for Chernarus plus additional buildings added here:

I have modified the loot so that:

Explosives have been removed.

Aircraft hangars spawn only metal scraps, circuit parts, engine oil, energy packs and vehicle repair kits

Industrial places are the place to find building materials.

Hospitals are now the only spawn points for medical items.

Supermarkets and pubs now only spawn food and drink.

Offical spawn items (items that you have to search) still spawn everywhere with the default loot.
